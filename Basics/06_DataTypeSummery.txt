JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. 
Because data type will automatically assigned at the time of compilation or code execution.

2 types of data 
Premetive and Non-Premetive
I) Premetive :- These are call-by-value.
                 The types of primitive data types include 
                 String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, and BigInt. 

1. String :- Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. 
            Example: "Hello, world!"
2. Number :- Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. 
            Example: 5, 3.14 
3. Boolean: Represents a binary value, either true or false, often used for conditional logic.

4.Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet. 
             Example: let x;.

5.Null:  standalone value it is represenataion of empty value it is special type and it is a object type. 
        Example: let y = null; 

6.Symbol (ES6): it is mostly used used to find uniqnece.

7.BigInt (ES11): Represents large integers that cannot be represented by the Number type. 

II) Call By Reference(non-premitive): These are call-by-reference. 
                                      The types of non-primitive data types are Array, Object, and Function. 
                                      The data type for these is 'object,' but for functions, they return a data type of 'function,' 
                                      though they also have an object data type.

1.Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs (properties and methods). 
          Example: { name: "John", age: 30 }.

2.Array: Represents a list-like collection of values, indexed by numbers (integer indices). 
         Example: [1, 2, 3, 4].

3.Function: Represents a reusable block of code that can be invoked or called with arguments. 
            Example: function add(x, y) { return x + y; }.



* Premitive Datatypes

                  Type                              typeof

i)            Number                               number
ii)           String                               string
iii)          Boolean                              boolean
iv)           Bigint                               bigint
v)            Symbol                               symbol
vi)           Null                                 object
vii)          Undefined                            undefined


* Non-Premitive OR Referance OR Object datatype

                  Type                                  typeof

i)               Object                                object
ii)              Array                                 object
iii)             Function                            function(object)
